// Chromium lazily opens a file descriptor to urandom the first time it needs a random number and
// re-uses it later on. This generally works well, but when using the mimic strategy, because a new
// subprocess is started for every child (i.e. the zygote is not used), this is not pre-initialized
// and then re-used across all forked processes. Therefore, when the ppapi process tries to load
// some random numbers, it can't open /dev/urandom now because the BPF sandbox has already been
// applied, and thus it fails.
// The workaround is to open /dev/urandom on process start, then use that saved file descriptor
// whenever Chromium later tries to open it. It's saved in initialize.cc, and here, it gets sent to
// Chromium when it tries to open it.
